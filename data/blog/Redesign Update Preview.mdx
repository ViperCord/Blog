Hey all,

For those who don't know my name is Rizon the Co-Owner here at Vipercord. I'm here today to show you preview's into the next update of Vipercord known as the Redesign Update.

Please note, this are all in development and subject to change.

# Cards

We have redesigned the cards to be finner, more modern, cleaner and more user friendly. As you can see tags were removed from the cards this is only temperary while we work out the redesign of them.

Heres a look!

# Bot Pages

With bot pages we have moved things around to make it look more cleaner and user friendly. We didn't change much just parts of it as we wanna make it look apart from the server list.

Heres a look!

# Bot Home pages

With the cards being redesigned and an influx with bots being added we have shortened the limit of cards allowed in the top voted section. This will make the website look a lot more cleaner and less cluttered.

Heres a look!
