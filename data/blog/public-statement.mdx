Hi everyone,

We wanted to make a public statement on our ongoing changes.

Firstly, the rebranding. This has sparked a lot of talks about why we are changing the name and logo, The current logo is from the previous company that owned the list, and the name change is to free up the name as “Vipercord” is our company name, and we have plans to use vipercord.com as our main company landing page.

Secondly, the removal of the discord server listing. This was a very unpopular service and was never really updated by our team. It may come back in the future under a new domain, but we have no plans for this at the moment. We mainly want all our resources to be based around discord bot listing.

Thirdly, the desktop client. We understand that using electron is chromium based, and we'll take every bit of feedback and improve on it. The desktop client will be postponed until we can change how it works and make it faster, more reliable, and without any worries of lagging.

Finally, we have massive future plans for this company. Leading up to gaming. This statement was released to show we are transparent about everything that goes on behind closed doors.

Thanks,

VBL Management
