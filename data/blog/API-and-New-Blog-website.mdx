# New API (Beta)

We have finally launched our API! The API is still in early stages of development, but you will be able to get bots and post your bots stats onto the website!

[Check out the documentation page!](https://docs.vipercord.com/methods/bots)

We will be working on so much more like:

- Widgets

- Post vote logs to your own discord server

- Libraries (Feel free to make your own if you like! You will have our 100% support on it!)

and much more in the future.

# Blog Website (Wait your on it)

On this blog post website we will be sending out sneak peaks, newest updates, future update and much more!

This blog website was created by Infinity development and we were allowed to use it under their licensing and permission. 100% of the credits go to them!

And That's all folks!
